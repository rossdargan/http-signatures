# http-signatures
A c# .net standard implementation of http signatures based very much so on this project: https://github.com/karlbohlmark/http-signatures-csharp

## Why not just do a pull request on the above project
I have two reasons.
- Firstly I wanted to separate the one project into three - one for use by clients, one for use on servers, and a core project. 
- Secondly that project is very old, and does't use things like httpclient etc. It would be very difficult to make backwards compatiable. My aim is to keep this project modern and light weight.

## Do you take pull requests
Absolutely! Feel free to open an issue to get my input on it first, but I'd love an extra pair of hands!
